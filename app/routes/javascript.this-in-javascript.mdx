Date: {attributes.date.toDateString()} &nbsp;

"this" is one of the difficult concept to learn in JavaScript.

What is "this"? &nbsp;
this is a keyword in JavaScript fuction. It has different value in different situation. So, it's confusing for Javascript beginners.

Example 1

```js
var name = "Jack";
console.log(this.name); //"Jack"
```

In this example, this will look for "name" (global variable) under window, so the result is "Jack."

Let's try to console.log(this) and see the result.

```js
console.log(this);
```

The result is Window.

So this refers to Window and this will look for name in global scope. That's why
this.name is Jack.

Let's see another example. What is this is inside a function?

Example 2

```js
var name = "Jack";
function namefu() {
  console.log(this.name);
}

namefu();
```

The result is same as example 1, this.name is "Jack". Why?

In example 2, this also refers to Window and like example 1, this will look for name in global scope.

Example 3

In strict mode, when this points to Window, the result will be undefined.

```js
"use strict";
var name = "Jack";
function namefu() {
  console.log(this.name);
}

namefu();
```

What if we put name in the function?

```js
"use strict";

function namefu() {
  var name = "Jack";
  console.log(this.name);
}
namefu();
```

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/mQ9vsqR.png" />

The result is also undefined. Because like example 2, this refers to Window.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/J2r4zMz.png" />

Then how do we fix the undefined issue in strict mode?

```js
"use strict";

var name = "Jack";
function namefu() {
  console.log(this.name);
}

var a = {
  name: "Ray",
  myname: namefu,
};
a.myname();
```

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YHOVvHo.png" />

We can see this.name is Ray because the owner of method myname is object a, so this refers to object a and will look for name inside object a.

## Object

Example 1

```js
var name = "Jack";
var obj = {
  x: this.name,
};
obj.x;
```

The result is Jack.

Example 2

What if the code is like this?

```js
var name = "Jack";
var obj = {
  x: function () {
    name = "Ray";
    console.log(this.name);
  },
  y: "2",
};

obj.x();
```

The result is undefined.

This will look for the name in obj and because there is no name property in obj, it returns undefined.

So if there is name property in obj, then the result will be Ray.

```js
var name = "Jack";
var obj = {
  x: function () {
    console.log(this.name);
  },
  y: "2",
  name: "Ray",
};

obj.x();
```

However, the example below will return differently.

```js
var name = "Jack";
var obj = {
  x: function () {
    name = "Ray";
    console.log(this.name);
  },
  y: "2",
};

var a = obj.x;
a();
```
